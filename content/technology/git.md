# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. Git was created to manage changes to the Linux kernel.

The fact that Git is a distributed system means that no central repository is needed. However, a central repository is necessary if multiple developers want to collaborate on the same code.

Traditionally, Git is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool, but some GUI (Graphical User Interface) based tools have been developed to lower the barrier to getting started with Git.
