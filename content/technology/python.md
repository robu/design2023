# Python

Python is a programming language that was launched in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. The programming language is dynamically typed and is characterized as a general-purpose language since it can be applied in many domains.

The programming language is distinguished by the fact that all data types are based on classes and objects. Another aspect that sets Python apart from other languages is that indentation is used to distinguish blocks in the code.

A program that prints out all even numbers between 1 and 100 could look like the following in Python:

```python
for number in range(1, 100 + 1):
    if not number % 2:
        print(number)
```
