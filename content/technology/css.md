# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, CSS, is a language for describing the appearance of elements in a markup language, such as HTML. CSS is one of the three technologies that constitute the foundation of the web.

In CSS, we use selectors to describe which elements we want to affect and then declare the style for the elements in a block.

For example, if we want to set the color of all paragraphs to blue, we do it in the following way.

```css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```
