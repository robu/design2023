# JavaScript

JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript constitutes the foundation of the web. JavaScript is dynamic, loosely typed, and treats functions as first-class objects.

JavaScript uses C-like syntax, but otherwise has nothing in common with the Java programming language.

A program that prints out all even numbers between 1 and 100 could look like the following in JavaScript:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (!(i % 2)) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
```
