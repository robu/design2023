# HTML

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) along with HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) forms the foundation of the web. Web pages are written in HTML and are then sent over the internet using HTTP.

HTML describes the content and structure of our websites and enables the loading of other documents, for example, CSS or JavaScript files.

HTML uses elements described by tags. Below is an example of a paragraph with a link in it:

```html
<p>A link to my <a href="mywebpage.html">web page</a></p>
```
