Robert's Home page
==========================

This is my home page written for the assignments in the course [PA1436, Teknisk webbdesign och användbarhet](https://bth.instructure.com/courses/5435).

I think this is the third course so far where I'm expected to share some personal background on a similar page such as this. I'm not sure what to write here, but I'll try to come up with something.

So, maybe this one will be more of a diary entry...

Me and my wife just sold an apartment in Spain. So now we're looking to maybe instead buy a summer house closer to where we live, in Täby, north of Stockholm. We haven't found the right one yet, but it's very educational to just attend the showings and learn more about the market and different potential areas where we would be interested in spending our summers.

The craziest one so far was a 12 hectar property, pretty much in the middle of the forest. It claimed to be one of the country's largest privately owned completely fenced-in properties, and had fallow deer (Swe: "Dovhjortar") planted on the property. It also had a pond of significant size, where both fish and crayfish could be found.

We didn't buy it, but we still talk about it, so maybe we should have?
