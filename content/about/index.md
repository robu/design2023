This site is built with the [Pico CMS](http://picocms.org/) (Content Management System) as an assignment in the course [PA1436, Teknisk webbdesign och användbarhet](https://bth.instructure.com/courses/5435) at [Blekinge Tekniska Högskola](https://www.bth.se/).

I'm using [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) as CSS preprocessor, and -- of course, since Pico is PHP based -- running it on a recent version of PHP on Apache.

Pico is a flat-file based CMS, which means that both content, configuration and themes/templates are stored as files on the server, and not in a database. It is a very simple and straightforward setup for "low rate of change" sites, such as this one. Both content and CMS files are stored in my github repo (link in footer).

The content is written in [markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and I use [my development environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) both to develop the site and to write the content.

Some [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are used to make the site look a bit nicer.
